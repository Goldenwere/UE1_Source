## About *Unknown Entity*

> Unknown Entity takes place on the Reservatarians' lunar bases on Om-4 B. They had peacefully used it for scientific research of the resources located on the moon, generating an atmosphere, and other topics of focus. Until now...  
The bases have been taken over by strange, bio-mechanical race of beings that they are dubbing as 'entities'. The planet has lost contact with the moon and has no idea what is happening.  
You are the main protagonist â€“ an UPAESI chief maintenance officer who usually works around to help develop advancements for astro-technology. You have no idea what is going on either. You lose contact with your team and must investigate alone the cause of the bases' sudden silence, and eliminate the threat you find before nearly 70 years of lunar progress is lost...
